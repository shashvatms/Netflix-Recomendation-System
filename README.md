🎬 Netflix Recommendation System using SVD
📌 Overview

This project implements a movie recommendation system inspired by the Netflix Prize dataset using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and collaborative filtering techniques. The goal is to analyze large-scale user rating data and generate personalized movie recommendations.

The project demonstrates a practical machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model-based recommendation, making it a strong showcase of applied ML concepts.

🚀 Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing of large rating datasets

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of user behavior and rating patterns

Collaborative filtering using matrix factorization (SVD)

Personalized recommendation generation

Visualization of rating distributions and insights

🧠 Machine Learning Approach

The recommendation engine uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to:

Learn latent relationships between users and movies

Reduce dimensionality of sparse rating matrices

Predict missing ratings

Generate personalized movie suggestions

This approach mirrors real-world recommender systems used by streaming platforms.
